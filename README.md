This is where I documented my first project while learning data analysis with the Incubator Hub

### Project Title: Project Analysis
---

### Project Overview
In our data analysis class, we learned how to use Excel, covering its fundamentals, basic formulas, data validation, and pivot tables. We also explored shortcuts to streamline our work in Excel with the aim of obtaining results that enable us to make informed decisions based on the data available.

### Data Sources 
The data we used in our Excel class was provided by our instructor, who also recommended websites and communities for sourcing data, such as Kaggle and FRED, where we can download datasets for free and participate in competitions.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as ;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which product are top sellers
- What are the products on peak sales 
...

### Data Analysis 
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX experessions used during our analysis;
```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
